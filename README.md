- 🌠 I’m interested in ... wait what am I interested in
- 🖍 I’m currently learning how to learn code stuff I want to try like, making my own version of some projects (nothing too big)
- 💞️ I’m not interested in collaboration at the moment
- 📫 How to reach me ... I don't know you can just reach me here
- 🪐 I’m not expecting many people to find me (and honestly I hope it stays that way)
